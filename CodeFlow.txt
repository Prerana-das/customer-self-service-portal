==============================
Code Flow – Example: Registration
==============================

1. Client sends a request
   - The user submits data from the frontend, for example, filling out the registration form.

2. Route receives the request
   - The API route matches the URL and directs the request to the corresponding controller.

3. Controller handles the request
   - The controller acts as the entry point and decides what needs to be done with the request.

4. Request class validates the data
   - Ensures the input is correct and authorized.
   - Example: For registration, it checks that name, email, and password are valid and not already in use.

5. DTO (Data Transfer Object) structures the data
   - Converts the request data into a clean, standardized object for the Action.
   - Example: Registration DTO contains only the fields needed to create a new user.

6. Action executes the business logic
   - Performs the main task, such as creating a new user, hashing passwords, or sending confirmation emails.

7. Controller returns the response
   - Sends the result back to the client, e.g., success confirmation or validation errors.

Purpose of this structure:
- Keeps code clean, organized, and maintainable.
- Separates validation, business logic, and data handling.
- Makes the system reusable, safe, and easy to test.
